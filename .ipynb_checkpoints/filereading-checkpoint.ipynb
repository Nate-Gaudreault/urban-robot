The Canid species, specifically the Gray Wolf, or the Canis lupus which the domesticated dog is an extremely close relative of, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.   The evolution of the domestic dog   The earliest remains of the domestic dog date from 10 to15 thousand years ago21; the diversity of these remains suggests multiple domestication events at different times and places. Dogs may be derived from several different ancestral gray wolf populations, and many dog breeds and wild wolf populations must be analysed in order to tease apart the genetic sources of the domestic dog gene pool. A limited mtDNA restriction fragment analysis of seven dog breeds and 26 gray wolf populations from different locations around the world has shown that the genotypes of dogs and wolves are either identical or differ by the loss or gain of only one or two restriction sites22. The domestic dog is an extremely close relative of the gray wolf, differing from it by at most 0.2% of mtDNA sequence.   In comparrison, the gray wolf differs from its closest wild relative, the coyote, by about 4% of mitochondrial DNA sequence14 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the molecular genetic evidence does not support theories that domestic dogs arose from jackal ancestors24. Dogs are gray wolves, despite their diversity in size and proportion; the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rate and timing 25.

       "  b'So the radiometric data stand: the Earth, moon, and older meteorites are all 4 or so billion years old, not just a few thousand.   Changing Decay Rates?   Another Creationist attempt to counter radiometric dates that are incompatible with their young-Earth religious position is to claim that decay rates are not constant, thereby throwing a monkey wrench into the calculations. There are at least two problems with this argument.   First, it is not at all clear how varying decay rates could result in multiple decay sequences all agreeing on the age of an object. Remember, for example, the oldest exposed rocks on earth, dated using different parent radioisotopes? All five of the decay sequences (Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, U-Pb, Th-Pb, and Lu-Hf) clustered right around 3.7 billion years. If decay rates vary enough to throw off dates by billions of years, why would they vary in exactly the way needed to consistently produce the same results?   Second, radioactive decay of nuclei is not comparable to chemical reactions. In chemistry, the rate at which chemical reaction proceeds can be altered in a number of ways, such as by changing the temperature, acidity, pressure, or reactant concentrations. Such changes, however, have essentially no effect on nuclear decay. In fact, experimental attempts to alter decay rates have been made, but failed.',\n",

By what you've said so far, it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus.   There are also contraceptive paths for women that don't involve condoms. If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant, why should the man be punished?   The message here should be simple. If you don't want an abortion, and aren't currently in a position where you can support your children, don't have unprotected sex. At the moment, it is the woman's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not, so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth. If you want to add men to that equation, you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion' (force their partner to have one), and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so. Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards; both consenting to sex, both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth. I doubt that that law would be a popular one, either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child, you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it.\",\n",

Coelophysis, from the late Triassic was one of the first theropod dinosaurs.   Deinonychus and Oviraptor from the late Triassic to the Cretaceous were bipedal advanced theropods, larger, with more bird-like skeletal features: semilunate carpal, bony sternum, long arms and reversed pubis. Striking detailed similarity to birds.   There is a gap in the fossil record here although Protoavis could belong here, unfourtunately, the fossil is poor.   Archaeopteryx from 225 Ma, shows a mosaic of reptilian and avian features, with the reptilian features predominating. The skull and skeleton are basically reptilian (skull, teeth, vertebrae, sternum, ribs, pelvis, tail, digits, claws, generally unfused bones). Bird traits are limited to an avian furcula (wishbone, for attachment of flight muscles; recall that at least some dinosaurs had this too), modified forelimbs, and -- the real kicker -- unmistakable lift-producing flight feathers. Archeopteryx could probably flap from tree to tree, but couldn't take off from the ground, since it lacked a keeled breastbone for large flight muscles, and had a weak shoulder compared to modern birds. (Wellnhofer, 1993)   S. santensis from 138 Ma was a better flyer than Archaeopteryx. It had a short trunk, claws on the toes, flight-specialized shoulders, stronger flight- feather bones, tightly folding wrist and short hands.   A not yet named bird/dino from 131 Ma has a reptilian pelvis and legs, with bird-like shoulders. The tail is medium-length with a fused tip.   Then there's Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, and other Cretaceous diving birds. There are many fossils. Their skeleton is further modified for flight showing fusion of pelvis bones, fusion of hand bones and a short, fused tail). It also still had true socketed teeth, a reptilian trait.   There are others and this is by no mean exhaustive. This is just to show that there are very good transition lineages.   Although no modern birds have teeth, chicken bills can be induced to develop teeth, indicating that chickens still retain the genes for making teeth.   There is also an intriguing fossil Microraptor gui that has flight feathers on both the front and back legs.   http://eur.news1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.c...2567138235.jpg   I can provide more info on any of these if you wish.

Once again you are interpreting what I have said through that sick and unbalanced mind of yours, and then extrapolating that I am now arguing in favor of calling my God an EPIC LIAR. Is it absolutely impossible for you to debate issues while actually responding to what we really say rather than reading into what we say and redefining it to fit your warped and perverse perspective?   I mean, how sick and disturbed must your powers of reason and logic be for you to interpret my argument that Man, because of our linear view of time, is misreading the fact that God placed the stars in space at the same time much more recently than it appears to us to have occurred, that God is then an epic liar? Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation? Is He the liar? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space?   It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective, isn't it obvious child!   But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time.   Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space.   But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there.\",\n",

Had paired fins with a leg-like arrangement of bones, and had an early-amphibian-like skull and teeth.   Eusthenopteron (and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish) -- intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the earliest amphibians. Skull very amphibian-like. Strong amphibian-like backbone. Fins very like early amphibian feet.   Icthyostegids (such as Icthyostega and Icthyostegopsis) -- Terrestrial amphibians with many of Eusthenopteron's fish features (e.g., the fin rays of the tail were retained). Some debate about whether Icthyostega should be considered a fish or an amphibian; it is an excellent transitional fossil.   Labyrinthodonts (e.g., Pholidogaster, Pteroplax) -- still have some icthyostegid features, but have lost many of the fish features (e.g., the fin rays are gone, vertebrae are stronger and interlocking, the nasal passage for air intake is well defined.)

       "  b'To Clive14:   Darwin never produced a \"Theory of Human Evolution\".   R--i--g--h--t. And I\\'m a Shakespearean act--o--r. Darwin\\'s book titled \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\" sure seems to me to suggest that he had an idea on the evolution of man. Darwinian evolution was (and still is) inherently a racist philosophy, teaching that different groups or \"races\" of people evolved at different times and rates, so some groups are more like their ape-like ancestors than others. Darwin believed, for instance, that the Australian Aboriginals were considered the missing links between an ape-like ancestor and the rest of mankind\". Many indigenous peoples died because of Darwinian evolution, so don\\'t give me such rubbish that Darwin never did a theory of human evolution.   Darwin\\'s evolutionary scheme went something like this:   Evolutionary ancestor --> Australoid --> Negroid --> Mongoloid --> Caucasoid.   Perhaps you best go home and check up on your own theory before you post such a remark. And people think that creationists are mis-informed!   This is true of the unscientific use of the word \"theory\". In science, \"theory\" is equivalent to \"fact\". There is a theory of gravity for example. Is gravity just guesswork therefore?   Once again, falsehood. If a theory is equivalent to fact, than why do they have two different things. In science, using you above example, gravity is a fact (I don\\'t think that there is a theory of gravity, at least it is not in the HSC Physics course when we were studying it!). By definition, a theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws. It is supported by experiments upon which it is based, and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation. Now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied? Now where, a theory is like a story to explain observed facts and phenomenon. A theory does not mean the idea is \"fact\". It is just a story used to explain how some observed phenomenon may have either came into existence, or why and how it behaves the way it does. You mis-interpretation of scientific terms is noted.   I disagree. Faith is believing something to be true regardless of the evidence. People have faith in the Bible. People do not (or should not) have faith in evolution.   I agree with your definition of faith. Bible believing creationists must take it by faith that there is a God, and that the Bible is the Inspired Word of God. Evolutionists (for the most part, i.e. most are atheistic), however, must take it by blind faith that there is no God and that the Bible is not the Inspired Word of God.   Your last sentence struck me as to how brainwashed some (or many people) are in the lie of evolution (microorganism into people evolution). For one, evolutionists must take it by blind faith that stuff has evolved, i.e. there is very few fossils that support this notion. The fossil record dismisses and is a crushing critque of Darwinian evolution. For example, Dr Ronald R. West (paleoecology and geology) stated in his article \"Paleoecology and uniformitarianism\" which was published in Compass, vol.45, May 1968, p. 216:   \"Contrary to what most scientists write, the fossil record does not support the Darwinian theory of evolution [microorganism to man] because it is this theory (there are several) which we use to interpret the fossil record. By doing so we are guilty of circular reasoning if we then say the fossil record supports this theory.\"   In addition to this, Dr David B. Kitts (School of Geology and Geophysics, Department of History of Science) in his article \"Paleontology and evolutionary theory\" in Evolution, vol. 28, September 1974, p. 467 says the following:   \"Despite the bright promise that paleonotlogy provides a means of \"seeing\" evolution, it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists the most notorious of which is the presence of \"gaps\" in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them. The gaps must therefore be a contingent feature of the record.\"   What they are saying is that the fossil record does not show evolution, but we will continue to believe it even though we have no proof of the theory of evolution (i.e. microorganism to man evolution).   Evolution has been proven. Creation has been disproven. This whole argument is over stubbornness on the part of people with faith who cannot bring themselves to accept that evolution has been proven and creation has been disproven.   Four words that always gets an evolutionist into trouble, \"Evolution has been proven\". If you refer to what you call \"micro-evolution\" (to which creationists call \"Varriation within a \"kind\"\") than I would agree with you. Species change all of the time, but it is important to know that the species never get more complex, they are constantly losing gentic information (i.e. DNA) and becoming less complex. With natural selection, things lose an ability that will enable a species to survive in an environment (usually by the way of mutations). So since varriation within a kind (or micro-evolution - always a loss of DNA) has been proved, this is also further evidence to the creationary model. The macro-evolution has not been proven. Nor does the fossil record bear out many evidences for this, as many leading evolutionary scientists have (or are comming) to realise.   Creation has not been disproven, as you falsely claim. Otherwise, the evolutionists here on this forum would be able to hammer the creationist arguments, and thus far they have not. This fact alone is evidence against you. They only gain an advantage when we start having silly debates on things that I do not know much on, nor have studied up on, such as geological features for an example. We have the same rocks, so of course the evolutionists are going to claim that in many cases I am wrong - as they have a different interpretation to me. Or they have a different story to explain who a land structure got there to me. Both stories are based on the evidence, so it is hard to get through to one another. Sadly, time restricts me from continuing.',\n",

It forces same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples while no one is forced to pay for their marriages. It denies them access to raise children and ability to cover their children and spouses with their medical insurance, along with the many other benefits of marriage. It uses the law to teach the people that the lifestyle and religion held by same-sex couples is wrong, and this forces them to feel the disapproval of society.   There is no reason to perpetuate these harms. I have heard many arguments opposed to same-sex marriage, but there is not even one of them that justifies these harms. In fact, I would even say that there is not one argument against same-sex marriage that makes logical sense at all. Thus, even if same-sex marriage brought no benefits, there would be no reason to keep it illegal; a free and equal society does not deny rights or benefits to anyone, unless it has a very good reason to. And there just isn't any reason to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples.\",\n",

Please do us both a favor before you go off on a discourse of the rights, or feelings or value of the fetus remember what I said about we as a society decided what is acceptable and what is not. We make these laws for ourselves for that reason, because we do attempt to value life. That attempt does not always satisfy all of the people all of the time, but it never will.   I don't need a formula to understand how our society functions nor do I stomp my foot and throw insults or intimidate people who don't see you being right. Nor would I justify behavior that from anybody else concerning something of less import would be unacceptable. If you don't like the law, then do something about it.

Indeed, I would say it is what psychologists call emergent downward causality.   As for the role of God, science has not disproven any of it. Science has explained how things occur but that does not eliminate the possibility of god nor does it limit what god does. We would simply not be understanding gods fit in the science of it. That makes sense given that god is considered infinite and we are finite. I think the soul is what gives us the possibility of even imagining the infinite. The idea that we can see beyond what we are or even to conceptualize such things gives a clue that there is more to us than meets the eye.   I do not see why God and science cannot coexist. Even evolution and creation. Forget planting evidence. That is too far fetched. I would rather think that it is more likely that what God says actually fits the evidence even though we cannot understand it. I do not know about God or \"not god\" (if you will) but if there is a God then the idea that he is beyond what I can actually conceive and yet completely conceivable makes sense for that kind of being.

Later, in the renewal of interest in the adequate teaching of science in the U.S. in the 1960s, there arose more modern \"creation science.\" It began by adopting the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventists as the base.   Creation science begins with the assertion the the creation stories, the flood story, even the mythology of Job and Jonah, are literally true. Creation scientists then attempt to distort the evidence to support this particular version of the Bible.

In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had.\",\n",

       "  b'Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it\\'s the RELATIONSHIP that I\\'m comparing. That\\'s what an analogy is. I\\'m NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean \"my ultimate agenda\"? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let\\'s compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that\\'s not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver\\'s ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It\\'s not exactly simple. You can\\'t ignore \"well regulate.\" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, \" \\'To put in good order\\' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia.\" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn\\'t the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that \"The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia.\" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned \"saturday night special.\" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents.

PLoS Genetics @ http://genetics.plosjournals.org/per...20105.eor&amp;ct=1 ). Various fossils continue to suggest some interbreeding.

The choice between our two stances is indeed one between choosing a moral stance based on reasoned analysis (imperfect as that may be) and choosing a moral stance based on blind faith (i.e. not supported by evidence) in a moral code dictated by a religious authority.   You say that my moral code is a code that puts faith only in myself. That is not true. I very openly acknowledge that if I never had input from the outside - moral codes which were presented to me with the reasons behind them - then my moral code as determined solely by myself would have been meager indeed. I have had a wide range of influences which have helped determined my moral code:   - The moral codes of my folks during my upbringing   - The moral code of the moderate form of Roman Catholicism I grew up with   - The moral codes generally accepted by the moderate Democratic part of society   - The moral stances of friends   - The moral philosophy of Kant and other philosophers I have read about   I am sure that I could even come up with more than that. From all of those, I have gleaned a morality that works best for me, where my moral code seems to be quite a common one. The moral rules which I accepted were typically the ones which gave the reasons behind them and whose base assumptions I agreed with. The moral rules which I rejected were typically the ones which gave no supporting reasons or whose base assumptions I disagreed with. I suspect that you assume that if a morality is not grounded in religious rules, then it becomes based on selfishness. That is not true. We are all inspired by heroes that sacrifice themselves for others - be they secular or religious (as Jesus himself can be viewed as a hero).   There is a lot of overlap in morality between secular morality and religious (mainly Christian) morality - against theft, murder, etc. However, I find too many of the religious rules very arbitrary (such as the anti-Gay propaganda, some religion\\'s ban on contraceptives, the idea of the infalibility of the pope, etc.) that I certainly will not follow religious rules blindly. Furthermore, so much of religious morality was determined simply by religious men who were set in the local morality of their time and attached that morality to the religion. Even if Jesus was divine, it would be very hard today to know how to throw away all the junk morality that was added after his time and extract the pure origin.',\n",

It is not true that science has \"found\" the mitochondrial Eve, nor is it true that it shows that one person can have all the DNA necessary for all the variation in human population. Both ideas are ridiculous in the extreme. The mitochondrial (note spelling monty) Eve is a mathematical concept. If the estimates of the mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA are correct, then she lived about 200,000 years ago or so.   And of course, the variation in human populations is carried by the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondria. High school biology students know this. And, of course, recent analysis has shown that every gene in the human genome has an average of 14 alleles. Since a single person can carry only two alleles of any gene, monty\\'s assertion becomes pure nonsense.   Hank says:   Really? When and by whom? I wasn\\'t even aware that it was an hypothesis but simply a mathematical concept derived from the mutation rate of the mitochondrial DNA.

The final one was overwhelming pro choice prior to her abortion. Attended rallies and everything. SHE felt so bad about havinghte abortion afterwards that 6 months later she blew her head off. She could not get it out of her head that she had killed a baby. She became totally obsessed and finally cracked.   So, yea...maybe it is not so out of line for people, including men, to say \"Think about it real hard because a lot of people regret it\". You don\\'t have to get shot to know it hurts.',\n",

Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said: ?we have a prior commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive?Moreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door.?',\n",

If I recall, it was in 1933 that, because of a combination of weakened capital situations from Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans which published lists of the loan takers, and a nation-wide banking holiday, banks around the country went through a new wave of demise, dropping the D/C and D/R ratios so sharply that, in one month alone, the money stock (M2) fell a whopping 4 1/2%.   Wasnt it under FDR that the NIRA codes, and, after 1935, the NLRA, enacted minimum wages, driving up nominal wages and thus unemployment?   Wasnt it during FDR administration that the reserve ratio was *doubled*, sending us back into another recession starting 1937?

What is really damaging to the concept of creationism as truth is a list of what we should expect if a flood had occurred under the same laws of science that are in operation today. One problem with creationism (I know, you want to ignore the problems) is that they constantly fall back on miracle in order to do a reset of reality in order to circumvent reality when creationism bumps into scientifically impossible events.   I don't mean to rain on the parade, but with all that said, it has been done. There is a list of 28 items, originally compiled by Jim Moore, that we should find if the flood happened as per the Bible. Not even miracles can solve these. That list is followed by further problems that have been compiled by Ken Harding from numerous sources.

For many women, the course of action that they need to take is quite clear.   That is, whether or not someone \\'should\\' have a difficult time with this decision, I don\\'t agree. And, I don\\'t think women\\'s motivations in getting abortions, or their personal behavior ITO becoming pregnant are anyone else\\'s concern. Or even if they do have an abortion *blithely*. (Distinguishing from policies about public health education.)   I just think people have to do what\\'s right for them. Finding that or reaching a decision -- well, people are different and have different lives. They have different understandings of biology, different health issues, different relationships, different economic positions, different religious views, or none at all. The circumstances around the pregnancy, different.   I don\\'t agree with the \"potentiality\" issue either. If *someone* isn\\'t there *yet*, they\\'re not in existence, period. I think there\\'s just an understandable human reaction to the beginning of life being taken. It\\'s not \"potential\" life. It\\'s life all right. But there\\'s no individual except in our imaginations.   To me, viability, sentience, the development of the nervous system and the brain, and the experience of pain in a fetus during the third trimester begin to mark the ethical boundaries. But those, too, as indicators, are not absolute. And the woman comes first. It\\'s between her and her physician. It\\'s not my job to judge whether she suffered appropriately enough or not.

No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets.

In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.

This is as specially true with Christianity because the texts do not explain how all the ceremonies are done. Baptism was performed in areas where full immersion could not have occurred but the best explanations of baptism paint a picture of a full immersion. The Church of Christ believes one must baptize in the name of Jesus, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost thing was while Jesus lived. Because the practice of speaking in tongues was used by the first church, some believe the art must stay in the church.   Most of the complications to Christianity is simply because the followers really believed Jesus would return. No one wrote a book on the Religion.   The Religion changed a great deal through time. King James was no saint and he had clear reasons he would not allow some letters into an authorized version he would sign on to.   One letter spoke of the sin of Slavery. This was clearly at odds with King James. Other items would have direct negative effects on the kingdom and I'll let others find the reasoning behind the withdraws.\",\n",

The difference between microevolution and evolution as an explanation for the beginning of a species is simple. In microevolution a species is simply adapting to it's environments. In evolution as is usually meant by the word you are talking about the formation of an entirely new creature from inorganic compounds. If this is possible I pose a few questions for you.   1) Why have no new creatures evolved from inorganic compounds in human memory?   2) How did these inorganic compounds decide that some creatures should evolve, while others of the same species did not? Why are there not some apes that have evolved into humans by now? Why didn't all apes evolve into humans?   3) One of my favorite pieces of confusion from evolutionists involve fossils. How do you know how old a fossil is? Every evolutionist I have asked has stated that fossils are dated by the rock layer they are found in, but if you then ask them how the rock layer is dated they answer that it is dated by the fossils that where discovered in it! That's a classical example of circular reasoning.   I am not a scientist, so I cannot present all the evidence against evolution as clearly as someone with a scientific education and background might do.

If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that\\'s gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable.   Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he\\'s an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don\\'t hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.   Didn\\'t mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I\\'ve heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn\\'t help them out because they were not \"good, church-going catholics.\" Basically because they didn\\'t go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn\\'t consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn\\'t because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It\\'s not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.   There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not \\'band together\\' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that \\'only religions\\' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it\\'s simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don\\'t believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it\\'s the right thing to do for their fellow man in need',\n",

If you wanted to solve a murder, for example, you take a look at the evidence. You have a gun, spent rounds, dead body etc. To convict someone of a murder, you need fingerprints, blood on clothes, DNA and such to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person you are accusing actually shot the deceased and you can convict WITHOUT an eye witness.   It's the same for science and the fossil record, because there is no-one around who directly observed animals undertaking large changes over time. But if you take a look at the fossil record, molecular biology, geological time etc, this is what it shows. From what we understand from the last 100 or so years of evidence and investigation, biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the diversity of life on earth.   3 questions for Calligirl.   For the 4th time. What would be YOUR definition of a transitional form?   When calculating the age of this earth, how precise do you expect or want scientists to get?

There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time \"channel\" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let\\'s say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also \\'channel\\', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological.

But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples.

       "  b'Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET**] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET**]) called the \"Cambrian Explosion.\"51   Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.38   Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET**] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, \"... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history.\"51   Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38   In Stephen J. Gould\\'s popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include \"a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world\\'s oceans.\"38   Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But \"one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs.\" Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38   There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38   Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to \"the last filament of a trilobite\\'s gill,\" or the last meal in a worm\\'s gut.38   The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38   Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, \"Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects.\"38   The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38   Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51   The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51   These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38   Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils\\' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38   Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38   \"The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time.\" - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology. BS Yeshiva College, MS Hunter College50   Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d50   http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm',\n",

This is quite simple, but that\\'s never really helped you see the problem before...   Yeesh. Even when I spell it out, he still can\\'t keep it straight.   No, marc, you\\'re looking at the wrong quote. Try reading what I write.   Yes, you can expect accusations of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine. Say, do you think these two things could possibly be related?   \"Concise and readable\" takes a backseat to accurate. As I said, Miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush. In fact, he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on, then moves past his exaggerated claim. And with good reason.   marc\\'s impeccable reading comprehension strikes again. marc thinks I was responding to a different point, despite the clear explanation of his \"citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts.\"   I figure it\\'s his latest attempt at a dodge. Ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him, apparently.   Considering atheists don\\'t believe in the supernatural, there\\'s nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.   Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the \"on\" position.   Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don\\'t have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin\\'s point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?   The best case you\\'ll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin\\'s claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.   Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.   This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I\\'d rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.   Oh, you didn\\'t read the part where he distanced himself from atheism?

They\\'re not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn\\'t a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They\\'re all phonies, aren\\'t they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people\\'s belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this \"power,\" too:marc is an atheist.

Clearly, I\\'ve correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.   In other words, marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh-so-powerful exchange:   marc [about Miller]: \"He\\'d think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.\"   Miller [about marc]: \"He\\'d think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.\"   *ahem*....   marc [about Miller]: \"He\\'d think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.\"   Miller [about marc]: \"He\\'d think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.\"   Yes, I\\'d speculate that he doesn\\'t have such trouble \"stomaching\" priests.

Life is not chaotic it is orderly and requires replication. Without this you just have a lot of chemicals mixing in an infinite variety.

Basically he told them they would be beaten, thrown in prison, crucified, and put to death if they followed him. And that is exactly what happened to the disciples and all those who gave a witness for Christ as Lord and Savior.   The various Roman emperors in those years of the early church sought to kill every Christian they could find, men, women, and children. Christians were crucified by the thousands, covered in pitch, and sit afire to provide light for the emporer's lavish garden parties. They were killed in the arena by wild animals and tortured to death in numerous ways. They were called martyrs, which now means one who dies for a cause. The word is Greek and means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwitness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. These witnesses for Christ were killed for their faith. How many Christians would we have today if they had to die for their faith? In spite of everything that the emperor did, they could not kill the Christians fast enough. More were believing in Christ every day, and eventually even the Roman emperor himself became a Christian and Christianity was embraced and sanctioned.\",\n",

Well if you don't think that gun control is the most important issue in the world and you totally agree that people should be able to own guns,but yet you have no problems with states making it mandatory for gun owners to have permits,thats almost a contradiction of terms for someone that says their pro gun.   I may be wrong but is anyone saying or implying total gun freedom?   What we are saying is, to many laws on it no more.   35-40 years ago we didn't have all this B.S.about it,you wanted a gun you went and got one (in other words very readily available)   Walk down the street with one and you didn't have a S.W.A.T.team on you.

Matt 26: 1 And it happened, when Jesus finished all these sayings, He said to His disciples, 2 You know that the Passover is coming after two days, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.   Of course there are valid reasons why Christ armed His men.   Romans 13: 1 Let every soul be subject to higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, but the existing authorities have been ordained by God. 2 So that the one resisting authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and the ones opposing will receive judgment to themselves. 3 For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire not to fear the authority? Do the good, and you will have praise from it; 4 for it is a servant of God to you for the good. But if you practice evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to the one practicing evil. 5 Because of this, it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience. 6 For on this account you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing. 7 Then give to all their dues: to the one due tax, the tax; to the one due tribute, the tribute; to the one due fear, the fear; to the one due honor, the honor.   Luke 11: 21 When the strong one, having been armed, guards his dwelling, his goods are in peace. 22 But as soon as one stronger than he comes, he overcomes him; he takes away his armor on which he relied, and deals out his arms.   \"a moments notice...\" Well it appears the guaranteed scheduled time is on the day of judgment.

It is an educated guess at best.   If you base your beliefs on science you will almost always have to change them so are they really beliefs?   Time and distance are 2 different entities. On the other side of the world it is a diffferent day.   A light year is the distance light would travel in a year if at the speed we have computed it to be on earth. How gravity affects light in space in pure specualtion as almost all of the cosmological theories are. Black holes were created to explain the big bang. There are lots of astonomers that are convinced the big bang is a myth.   If the stars were created near the earth and then streched out as the Bible says they were the relationship of time and distance would be quite different and would explain how light from a distant star could be seen.   No one really knows the answer so it is a matter of faith what you decide is true.   Both are possible according to science. The powers that be in science are atheist and get the most press. This does not make them right by default.   There is a very good book on this subject Starlight and Time if you are interested in what a brilliant scientist who believes in Creation has to say.   I will be suprised if you are.   I have read Hawkings and have him on audio and video.   To be fair you should take some time and study the opposing view IMO.\",\n",
